# DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY NOTES

## Design Brainstorming Part 1

See Disney Design Ideation Trello Board and News App Trello Board

## Design Brainstorming Part 2

Like the idea of using NASA picture of the day - use as a background with translucent/frosted glass containers for text/images etc

Splash Title of "Up-to-date" or "Up2D@te" or "Up2D8"

Use objects with 5 random people examples to store user information to showcase function 

{name:"max 10 characters", 

country: {[select from array?]}

location: "A-Z, a-z",

birthDay: "{[select from array 1 - 31],

birthMonth: {[array of months]}

favourite sport: {[array of sports]},
